 Several Indian ministers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s <br><br><br>cabinet have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past few days, underscoring the spread of the virus in the world’s second most populous nation.
Five ministers including Modi’s key aide and minister for internal security Amit Shah have contracted the virus which has infected nearly 2.4 million Indians. The south Asian nation has the highest death toll after U.S., Brazil and Mexico. Some of the ministers, including Shah, are in hospitals while others are recovering at home.

<<p>Chinese officials and economists have in recent months been unusually public in discussing worst-case scenarios under which China is blocked from dollar settlements, or Washington freezes or confiscates a portion of China’s huge U.S. debt holdings.

</p>Those concerns have galvanised some in Beijing to revive calls to bolster the yuan’s global clout as it looks to decrease reliance on the greenback.

<p>Some economists even float the idea of settling exports of China-made COVID-19 vaccines in yuan,</p> and are looking to bypass dollar settlement with a digital version of the currency.

<pre>“Yuan internationalisation was a good-to-have. It’s now becoming a must-have,” </pre>said Shuang Ding, head of Greater China economic research at Standard Chartered and a former economist at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC).
